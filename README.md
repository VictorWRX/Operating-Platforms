# Operating-Platforms

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wants to make a game that is web-based, and that can run on multiple platforms. The game is already made as an android app. The game is named “Draw It or Lose It”. The game consists of four one-minute rounds and will render images from a library of stock drawings as clues. The drawings are rendered linearly and complete at the 30 second mark. If the guessing team does not guess the puzzle before the one-minute time expires then the other teams will be given one chance each to solve the puzzle with a fifteen second time limit.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I would say that I did a couplle things well with this documentation. I think my UML design was a very good show of the programming. Also naming the design constriants was well written in this documentation.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I think that working through a design document really helps with just cementing a plan that has been worked out instead of working on something with no plan that has not been fully thought of. It is like playing darts in the dark sure you might get on the board at times but if the light was on you would get a lot closer.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would say that my recommendations lacked a bit especially with the operating system architecture and I think I would improve this by giving more details so that the client wouild have all the information to make a better decision.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs as some design constriants. I did it this way because in the end if the user does not want to use the game the game is ultimatly worthless. I implemented the game around what the user's would need in order to make the game worth while. Also while thinking about what the client needed in order for a smooth end user feel. 


# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I used to just wing it really. I usually would not prepare at all and this would make it so that I would be at the computer for hours thinking about my next step. I think that having at least a rough draft of a software design document will help in the future. Just knowing where to go after programing something would be very helpful.
